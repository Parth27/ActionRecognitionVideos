# Action-Recognition-in-Videos
This project implements a new technique called Gate-Shift Networks, with some modifications, to detect actions in videos.

The paper that introduced this approach can be found her: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.00381.pdf

The dataset used for this project is UCF-101, which can be found here: https://www.crcv.ucf.edu/data/UCF101.php

I have implemented this model on a much smaller dataset than what it was built for, after making some slight modifications to it, and achieved really good results.

Implemented the model using Pytorch and OpenCV.
