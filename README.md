# Action Recognition in Videos
Implementation of a new technique called Gate-Shift Networks, with some modifications, to detect actions in videos.

The paper that introduced this approach can be found her: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.00381.pdf

The dataset used for this project is UCF-101, which can be found here: https://www.crcv.ucf.edu/data/UCF101.php

Implemented the model using Pytorch and OpenCV.
